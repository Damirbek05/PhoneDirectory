This is a simple phonebook web application built using Java 17+, Spring Boot 3, Vaadin, MongoDB, and Gradle. The app allows users to view, add, and edit contacts. It includes features like email (Gmail) and phone number validation, and the `id` field is auto-incremented starting from 1. The app can generate reports in formats like PDF, Word, or HTML.

To run the application, clone the repository, open the project in IntelliJ IDEA, and run it. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
